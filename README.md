Disclaimer: I know this code is trash. I couldn't sleep one night and just threw this together.

Why does this file exist?

In a continued effort to ensure masto.nyc users have access to a healthy ecosystem of federated servers, and also a safe environment, the mod team wanted to take a look at the auto-blocked/silenced servers from other blocklists. The goal is to gather more info on larger servers that may make their way onto third party blocklists. 

Just use the file from Mastodon -> Moderation -> Federation -> Export as an argument here.
